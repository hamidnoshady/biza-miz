/**
 * Expense management — the DB-touching half of the Expenses subledger.
 *
 * Categorised operating expenses recorded as paid, not owed — the AP subledger
 * already models a bill owed to a specific supplier; genericising that to cover
 * "money spent on rent" would blur two different things. "Categorised" needs no
 * new taxonomy: the expense account chosen is the category. Every expense posts
 * a real journal entry through the same `postJournalEntry()` every other posting
 * path uses, so it is subject to the fiscal-period lock exactly like everything
 * else.
 *
 * Issue #832 turned this from a form that writes two tables into a register an
 * accountant can trust, by giving it the three things it was missing:
 *
 *  - **reversal** (`reverseExpense`), so a wrong expense is corrected the way a
 *    ledger corrects anything — a second, dated, mirrored entry beside the
 *    first, both visible, the pair netting to zero. Never an edit, never a
 *    delete: a register whose totals can be rewound by hand is not evidence.
 *  - **the payment-source rule** (`expense-accounts.ts`), so «پرداخت از» can
 *    only ever be answered with cash, a bank, a float or a card-settlement
 *    account instead of any asset account in the chart.
 *  - **the date rule** (`expense-input.ts`), enforced here rather than only in
 *    the browser, so the API, the importer and the AI cannot record what the
 *    form refuses.
 *
 * DB-touching, so per repo convention it has no direct unit test: the rules live
 * in the pure modules above (unit-tested), and this file is covered by
 * `integration/expense.integration.test.ts`.
